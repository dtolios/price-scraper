# price-scraper
A simple Node.js command line application that goes to an ecommerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet.

Utilizes the native node libraries for http requests and file system access, while bringing in the cheerio module for DOM scraping, and the csv module for csv stringifying.
